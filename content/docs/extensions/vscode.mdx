## Usage

### Automatic Analysis

The extension automatically activates when you open a workspace containing:

- `package.json` (npm/Node.js projects)
- `requirements.txt` (Python/pip projects)
- `pubspec.yaml` (Flutter/Dart projects)

### Manual Commands

Access these commands via Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`):

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Pack-Man: Analyze Dependencies` | Analyze the active package file |
| `Pack-Man: Analyze Workspace` | Analyze all package files in workspace |
| `Pack-Man: Update All Dependencies` | Update all outdated packages in active file |
| `Pack-Man: Show Analysis` | Open detailed analysis webview |

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+Shift+P A` (or `Cmd+Shift+P A` on Mac) - Analyze Dependencies
- `Ctrl+Shift+P U` (or `Cmd+Shift+P U` on Mac) - Update All Dependencies

## Configuration

Configure Pack-Man through VS Code settings (`File > Preferences > Settings` or `Ctrl+,`):

### API Endpoint

```json
"packman.apiEndpoint": "https://pack-man.vercel.app"
```

Change this to use a self-hosted Pack-Man instance.

### Auto-analyze on Save

```json
"packman.autoAnalyzeOnSave": true
```

Automatically re-analyze dependencies when you save package files.

### Show CodeLens

```json
"packman.showCodeLens": true
```

Display inline status indicators above dependencies.

### Show Diagnostics

```json
"packman.showDiagnostics": true
```

Show outdated/error dependencies in the Problems panel.

### GitHub Token (Secure Storage)

For private repositories or to increase API rate limits:

1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Search for "Preferences: Open Settings (UI)"
3. Search for "Pack-Man"
4. Click "Edit in settings.json" for GitHub Token
5. The token is stored securely in VS Code's SecretStorage

**Benefits of GitHub Token:**
- Access private repositories
- Increased rate limits (5000/hour vs 60/hour)
- Better reliability for large projects

## Supported Package Managers

### npm (package.json)

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "axios": "^1.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "vitest": "^4.0.0"
  }
}
```

### pip (requirements.txt)

```
django==4.2.0
requests>=2.28.0
pytest~=7.3.0
```

### pub (pubspec.yaml)

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  http: ^1.0.0

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
```

## Quick Start Example

### 1. Create a Test Project

```bash
mkdir test-packman && cd test-packman
```

### 2. Create package.json

```json
{
  "name": "test-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.0",
    "axios": "^0.21.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "vitest": "^3.0.0"
  }
}
```

### 3. Open in VS Code

```bash
code .
```

### 4. Observe the Extension

You should see:
- ⚠️ CodeLens indicators above each dependency showing available updates
- 🟡 Status bar showing "Dependencies: 3 outdated"
- Hover information when you mouse over package names
- Warnings in the Problems panel (`Ctrl+Shift+M`)

### 5. Update Packages

- Click "Update" on any CodeLens indicator to update that package
- Or use `Pack-Man: Update All Dependencies` to update everything

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Activating

**Problem:** Extension doesn't activate when opening package files.

**Solutions:**
- Ensure the file is named correctly (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, or `pubspec.yaml`)
- Check that the file is in the workspace root or a subdirectory
- Reload VS Code window (`Ctrl+Shift+P` > "Reload Window")

### No CodeLens Indicators

**Problem:** Inline indicators don't appear above dependencies.

**Solutions:**
- Check that `packman.showCodeLens` is enabled in settings
- Verify the file is a valid package file
- Wait a few seconds for initial analysis to complete
- Check Output panel (`View > Output` > select "Pack-Man") for errors

### API Connection Issues

**Problem:** "Failed to analyze dependencies" errors.

**Solutions:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify `packman.apiEndpoint` is correct in settings
- Check if you're behind a proxy or firewall
- Try again in a few minutes (might be temporary API issue)

### Rate Limit Errors

**Problem:** "Rate limit exceeded" messages.

**Solutions:**
- Configure a GitHub token in settings (increases limit to 5000/hour)
- Wait for the rate limit to reset (usually 1 hour)
- Use caching to reduce API calls

### Updates Not Working

**Problem:** Update commands fail or don't change the file.

**Solutions:**
- Ensure the file is not read-only
- Check file permissions
- Verify you have write access to the file
- Close other programs that might have the file open

### Private Repository Access

**Problem:** Can't analyze dependencies in private repositories.

**Solutions:**
- Configure a GitHub token with appropriate permissions
- Ensure the token has `repo` scope for private repositories
- Verify the token is valid and not expired

## Performance

The extension is designed to be lightweight and efficient:

- **Activation Time**: < 500ms
- **Parsing**: Incremental parsing with caching
- **CodeLens Updates**: Debounced by 300ms
- **API Calls**: Cached for 5 minutes (success) or 2 minutes (errors)
- **Memory**: Minimal footprint with automatic cleanup

## Privacy & Security

- **GitHub Tokens**: Stored securely in VS Code's SecretStorage (encrypted)
- **API Communication**: HTTPS only
- **No Telemetry**: Extension doesn't collect or send usage data
- **Local Processing**: File parsing happens locally
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests necessary VS Code API permissions
