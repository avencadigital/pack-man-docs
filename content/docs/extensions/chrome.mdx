## Troubleshooting

### Enhanced Error Messages (v1.3.0)

The extension now provides context-aware error messages with specific guidance:

#### 🔒 Private Repository Detected
**Message:** "Authentication required: Add a GitHub token with 'repo' scope to access private repositories."

**Action:** Click "Configure Token" button to set up authentication

#### ⏱️ GitHub API Rate Limit Exceeded
**Message:** "Tip: Add a GitHub token to increase your rate limit from 60 to 5,000 requests per hour."

**Action:** Click "Add Token" button to configure authentication

#### ⏱️ Request Timed Out
**Message:** "The analysis took too long. This might be due to a slow connection or large dependency file."

**Solution:** Try refreshing the page or check your internet connection

#### 🔌 Pack-Man API Unavailable
**Message:** "Unable to reach the analysis service. Please try again in a moment."

**Solution:** Wait a few moments and refresh the page

#### 🔍 Repository or Dependency File Not Found
**Message:** "This repository may not contain package.json, requirements.txt, or pubspec.yaml files."

**Solution:** Verify the repository contains supported dependency files

### Common Issues

#### "Repository not found or is private"
- No token configured - Add a GitHub token to access private repositories
- Invalid token - Ensure your token is valid and not expired
- Missing permissions - Your token needs the `repo` scope for private repositories
- Repository doesn't exist - Check if the repository URL is correct

#### "Access denied" or 403 errors
- **Rate limit exceeded** - Without a token, you're limited to 60 requests/hour. With a token, it's 5,000/hour
- **Token lacks permissions** - Ensure your token has the `repo` scope
- **Token expired or revoked** - Generate a new token if needed

#### Extension Communication Errors
- **Extension needs reload** - Reload the extension from chrome://extensions/
- **Service worker inactive** - Click the extension icon to wake it up
- **Check logs** - Open DevTools for detailed error information

### Debugging

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to the extension's background page:
   - Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Find Pack-Man extension
   - Click "background page" or "service worker"
3. Check the Console tab for detailed logs
4. Look for messages starting with "Background:" for debugging information

## API Rate Limits

| Type | Without Token | With Token |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Requests/hour | 60 | 5,000 |
