# API Reference

The Pack-Man API is a RESTful interface that allows you to analyze software project dependencies. It supports multiple package managers (npm, pip, pub) and provides detailed information about dependency update status.

## Key Features

- ✅ Dependency analysis from configuration files
- 🐙 GitHub repository integration with automatic file detection
- 🔍 Updated version checking against official registries
- 📊 Project summary statistics
- 🔗 Detailed package information (description, homepage)
- 🚀 Support for npm (package.json), pip (requirements.txt), and pub (pubspec.yaml)
- 🔐 GitHub token support for private repositories

## Base URLs

- **Development:** `http://localhost:3000`
- **Production:** [URL will be defined after deployment]

## Authentication
