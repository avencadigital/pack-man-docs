# GitHub Integration

Pack-Man can analyze dependencies directly from GitHub repositories, automatically detecting and analyzing dependency files without manual download.

## Features

- **Automatic File Detection** - Searches for package.json, requirements.txt, and pubspec.yaml
- **Multiple File Support** - Handles repositories with multiple dependency files
- **Private Repository Access** - Works with private repos when configured with a GitHub token
- **Real-time Validation** - Validates repository URLs as you type
- **Progress Tracking** - Shows detailed progress during repository analysis

## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step>
### Enter Repository URL

Paste a GitHub repository URL in the format:
```
https://github.com/owner/repository
```

The URL is validated in real-time with visual feedback.
</Step>

<Step>
### Automatic File Discovery

Pack-Man searches the repository root for supported dependency files:
- `package.json` (npm)
- `requirements.txt` (pip)
- `pubspec.yaml` (pub)
</Step>

<Step>
### Select and Analyze

If multiple files are found, select the one you want to analyze. The file is downloaded and analyzed automatically.
</Step>
</Steps>

## URL Validation

Pack-Man validates GitHub URLs in real-time:

### Valid URL Formats

✅ `https://github.com/owner/repo`
✅ `http://github.com/owner/repo`
✅ `github.com/owner/repo`

### Invalid URL Formats

❌ `https://github.com/owner` (missing repository)
❌ `https://gitlab.com/owner/repo` (not GitHub)
❌ `https://github.com/owner/repo/tree/main` (includes path)

<Callout type="info">
Pack-Man automatically adds `https://` if you paste a URL without protocol.
</Callout>

## Private Repositories

To analyze private repositories:

1. **Create a GitHub Token** - Follow the [GitHub Token Setup](/docs/getting-started/github-token) guide
2. **Configure Token** - Add your token in the GitHub Token Configuration dialog
3. **Analyze Repository** - Enter the private repository URL and analyze normally

<Callout type="warn">
Without a token, you can only analyze public repositories and are limited to 60 requests per hour.
</Callout>

## Rate Limits

| Type | Without Token | With Token |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Requests/hour | 60 | 5,000 |
| Private repos | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Recommended for | Testing | Production |

## Multiple Dependency Files

When a repository contains multiple dependency files:

1. All supported files are displayed with their details
2. Each file shows:
   - File name and type
   - File size
   - Package manager
3. Click "Analyze" on any file to start analysis

<Callout type="info">
If only one dependency file is found, it's automatically selected for analysis.
</Callout>

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

**Repository not found**
- Verify the URL is correct
- Check if the repository is private (requires token)
- Ensure the repository exists

**No dependency files found**
- Repository may not have dependency files in the root
- Files may be in subdirectories (not currently supported)
- File names may not match standard conventions

**Rate limit exceeded**
- Wait for the rate limit to reset
- Configure a GitHub token for higher limits
- Token increases limit from 60 to 5,000 requests/hour

**Access denied (403)**
- Repository is private and no token is configured
- Token lacks required permissions
- Token may be expired or revoked

## Progress Stages

During analysis, you'll see progress through these stages:

1. **Validating URL** - Checking if the URL is valid
2. **Searching repository** - Looking for the repository
3. **Searching for dependency files** - Finding supported files
4. **Downloading file** - Fetching file content
5. **Analyzing packages** - Checking package versions

## Best Practices

### For Public Repositories

- No token required for basic usage
- Be mindful of rate limits (60 requests/hour)
- Consider adding a token for frequent use

### For Private Repositories

- Always configure a GitHub token
- Ensure token has `repo` scope
- Store token securely (never share it)

### For Organizations

- Use a dedicated service account token
- Monitor rate limit usage
- Consider caching results for frequently analyzed repos

## Troubleshooting

### URL Not Validating

- Check for typos in the URL
- Ensure it's a GitHub URL (not GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)
- Remove any path segments after the repository name

### Files Not Found

- Verify files exist in the repository root
- Check file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure files are committed to the default branch

### Download Fails

- Check your internet connection
- Verify the file isn't too large (>1MB may timeout)
- Try again after a few seconds

### Token Issues

- Verify token is valid and not expired
- Check token has correct permissions (`repo` scope)
- Try generating a new token if problems persist

## API Integration

You can also use the GitHub integration programmatically:

```javascript
import { githubService } from '@/lib/github-service';

// Search for dependency files
const files = await githubService.searchDependencyFiles('owner', 'repo');

// Download file content
const content = await githubService.downloadFileContent(files[0].downloadUrl);

// Analyze with Pack-Man API
const response = await fetch('/api/analyze-packages', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    content,
    fileName: files[0].name
  })
});
```

- Explore the [Chrome Extension](/docs/extensions/chrome) for in-context analysis
- Check the [API Reference](/docs/api/analyze-packages) for programmatic access
