# Analyzing Dependencies

Pack-Man provides three flexible methods to analyze your project dependencies. Choose the method that best fits your workflow.

## Input Methods Overview

| Method | Best For | Features |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **File Upload** | Local files | Drag & drop, file browser |
| **Paste Content** | Quick checks | Auto-detection, no file needed |
| **GitHub URL** | Remote repos | Auto-discovery, private repo support |

## Method 1: File Upload

Perfect for analyzing local dependency files with drag-and-drop convenience.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Select Upload Tab

Click the "File Upload" tab in the analysis section.
</Step>

<Step>
### Choose Your File

**Option A: Drag and Drop**
- Drag your dependency file into the upload area
- Visual feedback shows when file is ready to drop

**Option B: File Browser**
- Click "Choose File" button
- Navigate to your dependency file
- Select and open the file
</Step>

<Step>
### Verify and Analyze

- File name and size are displayed
- File type is automatically detected
- Click "Analyze" to start the analysis
</Step>
</Steps>

### Supported Files

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pip', 'pub']}>
  <Tab value="npm">
    **package.json**
    - Location: Project root
    - Contains: dependencies, devDependencies
    - Format: JSON
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pip">
    **requirements.txt**
    - Location: Project root
    - Contains: Python packages with versions
    - Format: Plain text
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pub">
    **pubspec.yaml**
    - Location: Project root
    - Contains: dependencies, dev_dependencies
    - Format: YAML
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Method 2: Paste Content

Ideal for quick analysis without file management.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Select Paste Tab

Click the "Paste Content" tab in the analysis section.
</Step>

<Step>
### Paste Your Content

- Copy content from your dependency file
- Paste directly into the text area
- File type is automatically detected from content structure
</Step>

<Step>
### Review and Analyze

- Detected file type is shown with a badge
- Content is validated in real-time
- Click "Analyze" to start the analysis
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
Pack-Man automatically detects file type by analyzing content structure:
- JSON format → package.json (npm)
- Line-based with `==` or `>=` → requirements.txt (pip)
- YAML with `dependencies:` → pubspec.yaml (pub)
</Callout>

## Method 3: GitHub URL

Analyze repositories directly without downloading files.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Select GitHub Tab

Click the "GitHub URL" tab in the analysis section.
</Step>

<Step>
### Enter Repository URL

Paste a GitHub repository URL:
```
https://github.com/owner/repository
```

URL validation happens in real-time with visual feedback.
</Step>

<Step>
### Search for Files

Click "Search Dependency Files" to discover available files in the repository.
</Step>

<Step>
### Select and Analyze

- All found dependency files are listed
- Click "Analyze" on the file you want to check
- File is downloaded and analyzed automatically
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warn">
For private repositories, configure a [GitHub token](/docs/getting-started/github-token) first.
</Callout>

## Analysis Process

Once you start analysis, Pack-Man:

1. **Parses the file** - Extracts package names and versions
2. **Queries registries** - Checks latest versions from npm, PyPI, or pub.dev
3. **Compares versions** - Determines if packages are up-to-date or outdated
4. **Generates report** - Creates detailed analysis with statistics

### Progress Tracking

During analysis, you'll see:
- Real-time progress bar (0-100%)
- Current stage indicator
- Estimated time remaining
- Number of packages processed

### Analysis Time

Typical analysis times:
- **Small projects** (< 10 packages): 2-5 seconds
- **Medium projects** (10-50 packages): 5-15 seconds
- **Large projects** (> 50 packages): 15-30 seconds

<Callout type="info">
Analysis time depends on the number of packages and registry response times.
</Callout>

## Understanding Results

After analysis completes, you'll see:

### Summary Statistics
- Total packages analyzed
- Up-to-date packages (green)
- Outdated packages (orange)
- Packages with errors (red)

### Package Details
For each package:
- Current version vs. latest version
- Package description
- Homepage link
- Update command
- Status indicator

### Status Types

| Status | Color | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Up-to-date | 🟢 Green | Current version matches latest |
| Outdated | 🟠 Orange | Newer version available |
| Error | 🔴 Red | Unable to fetch version info |

## Troubleshooting

### File Not Detected

**Problem:** File type not recognized

**Solutions:**
- Ensure file name matches standard conventions
- Check file format is valid (JSON, YAML, or plain text)
- Try pasting content instead of uploading

### No Packages Found

**Problem:** Analysis returns zero packages

**Solutions:**
- Verify file contains dependency declarations
- Check for syntax errors in the file
- Ensure dependencies section exists and is not empty

### Analysis Fails

**Problem:** Analysis stops with an error

**Solutions:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify file content is valid
- Try again after a few seconds
- Check if package registries are accessible

### Slow Analysis

**Problem:** Analysis takes too long

**Solutions:**
- Large projects naturally take longer
- Check your internet connection speed
- Package registries may be experiencing delays
- Consider analyzing smaller dependency subsets

## Best Practices

### For Accurate Results

- Use the most recent version of your dependency file
- Ensure file syntax is valid before analysis
- Include all dependency sections (dependencies, devDependencies)

### For Faster Analysis

- Remove commented-out dependencies
- Clean up unused packages before analysis
- Use GitHub URL method for remote repositories

### For Private Projects

- Configure GitHub token for private repositories
- Never share dependency files containing secrets
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
