# GitHub Token Setup

Pack-Man can work with or without a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT). However, using a token provides several benefits.

## Why Use a GitHub Token?

<Callout type="info">
Using a GitHub token is optional but highly recommended for the best experience.
</Callout>

### Benefits

- **Higher rate limits**: 5,000 requests per hour (vs 60 without token)
- **Access to private repositories**: If you have access to them
- **Better reliability**: Reduced chance of hitting rate limits

### Rate Limits Comparison

| Authentication | Requests per Hour |
|----------------|------------------|
| No Token       | 60               |
| With Token     | 5,000            |

## Creating a GitHub Personal Access Token

<Steps>
<Step>
### Navigate to GitHub Settings

Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
</Step>

<Step>
### Generate New Token

Click "Generate new token" > "Generate new token (classic)"
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Token

- Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "Pack-Man Dependency Analyzer")
- Set an expiration date (recommended: 90 days or 1 year)
- Select the following scopes:
  - `public_repo` - Access to public repositories
  - `repo` - Full access to private repositories (only if needed)
</Step>

<Step>
### Copy Token

Click "Generate token" and copy it immediately - you won't be able to see it again!
</Step>
</Steps>

## Configuring the Token

### In the Web Application

1. Open Pack-Man in your browser
2. Click on "Settings" in the navigation menu
3. In the "GitHub Token Configuration" section:
   - Paste your token in the input field
   - Click "Save Token"
   - The system will validate your token automatically

### In the Chrome Extension

1. Click the Pack-Man extension icon in your browser toolbar
2. Paste your GitHub token in the input field
3. Click "Save Token"
4. The extension will validate the token and display your GitHub username if successful

### For Local Development

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Then restart the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Token Security

<Callout type="warn">
Never commit tokens to version control or share them publicly.
</Callout>

### Best Practices

- Use environment variables for server deployments
- Regularly rotate your tokens
- Use minimal required permissions
- Monitor token usage in GitHub settings
- Revoke unused tokens

## Troubleshooting

### Token Validation Failed

- Ensure the token is copied correctly (no extra spaces)
- Check that the token hasn't expired
- Verify the token has the required scopes

### Rate Limit Issues

- Check your current rate limit in the Settings page
- Wait for the rate limit to reset (shown in the interface)
- Consider using a token if you haven't already

### Private Repository Access

- Ensure your token has `repo` scope (not just `public_repo`)
- Verify you have access to the repository
- Check that the repository URL is correct

## Token Management

- **View current status**: Go to Settings to see if a token is configured
- **Update token**: Simply paste a new token and save
- **Remove token**: Click "Remove Token" in the Settings page
- **Check rate limits**: View remaining requests in the Settings page
